                    <p>To gain a broad understanding of how students interact with the Memorial Union, we conducted a survey that garnered 66 responses. Nearly all of our responders were UC Davis students, which became the target audience of our app. We had a diverse pool of respondents with students ranging from all academic standings.</p>

                        <p>This shows that the MU is a highly utilized space on campus, thus there is a great need for an app that helps students make the most out of their experience at the MU.</p>

Students want to learn most about social events and basic needs services. Here, we faced our first challenge. We needed to decide whether to focus on highlighting popular services or bring awareness to lesser known services.</p>

                    <h2>Interviews</h2>
                    <p>To gain a deeper understanding of how a range of students interact with the MU, we conducted 17 interviews. Here are some key insights we learned from our interviews:</p>

                    <p>Though students mentioned in the survey that they would be interested in learning more about different basic needs services, they elaborated in the interviews that they would like to have access to that information but it is not a priority for them. This is because they only utilize these services when they need them. Thus, we decided to place the emphasis of our app on highlighting popular services rather than helping students learn more about lesser known services since they did not seem interested.</p>

                    <h2>Mid-fidelity prototypes</h2>
                    <h3>Study</h3>
                    <p>To showcase study spots in the MU, we implemented a horizontal scroll layout with card components for easy readability. We included information about seating availability and hours on each card component in addition to buttons that indicated the booking status of each room.</p>
                    <p>An important thing to note is that we designed our first version of mid-fidelity wireframes under the impression that any student could book a study room with their choice of seat layout. We later discovered that only leaders of a student organization can book a study room which led to a pivot in user flow for user testing. To be more specific, we got rid of the user flow for booking and only made use of our study home screen and calendar screen during user testing.</p>

                    <p>Our Food tab implements a vertical scroll layout with card components showcasing important information like hours and wait times for each restaurant in the Memorial Union. Each card takes you to a dedicated page for the restaurant that allows users to filter a live menu of the restaurant’s selection by type, recommendations, and availability.</p>
                    <p>Additional information like a complete list of a restaurant’s hours, their phone number, as well as a popular times chart, can be found by tapping the right pointing arrow at the header of the page.</p>

                    <h3>Social</h3>
                    <p>The Social page is dedicated to all social activities at the MU such as events and games. We added a carousel for a quick view of upcoming MU events and added a “See More” button for users to view these events in a calendar view that was influenced by Google Calendar and Apple Calendar for the design and user flow. When a user clicks on a date, an hourly view of the selected date is displayed as a popup. When they click on an event, the popup switches to a detailed popup of that event. There, they are able to learn more about the event and add the event to their personal calendar if they choose to do so.</p>
                    <p>The Social page also allows users to explore the Games Area, a recreational center with activities such as billiards, bowling, and gaming. They can view a popular times chart to avoid long wait times and click on a card component to learn more about different games.</p>

                    <p>With the Services tab, we played around with different styles and layouts to find the best way to showcase the range of services at the MU and what each service does. We strived to include information such as hours and a description of each service.</p>

                    <p>Following our mid-phase evaluation, we sought for feedback on our design and prototype by conducting usability tests.</p>
                    <p>We conducted a series of 7 usability tests specifically targeting current UC Davis students. These tests encompassed four distinct sets of tasks: Study, Food, Social, and Services.</p>
                    <p>These tests provided valuable insights into the pain points and strengths of our design and prototype. Through these tests, we found 3 main pain points.</p>

                        <p>During the usability tests focused on the Study page, we identified a problem where users were mistakenly led to believe that they could book study rooms through the app. To address this, we implemented a helper tab that explicitly states that the rooms are only bookable for student organizations. This solution aims to prevent confusion and ensure that users have accurate expectations regarding the availability of study rooms.</p>

To address this, we added helper text to guide users to the popular times page and clarified that the app does not currently support ordering. These changes aim to improve user understanding and streamline the process of checking wait times for food.</p>

To address this, we implemented a list view along with a search bar, allowing users to quickly and efficiently browse through all the events at a glance. This solution aims to improve user experience and provide a convenient way for students to explore and engage with the various events happening at the MU.</p>

                            <li>Difficulty with UX Copy and UX Writing to inform users about app features where we struggled to clearly showcase study room rules and the menu stock availability feature</li>
                            <li>Providing context for users to easily navigate through the app while avoiding cognitive overload</li>
                            <li>Creating an interactive map of the MU without sacrificing UI</li>

                        <li> <span class="body-black">Conduct more user research on faculty and visitors.</span><br>Since our respondents are nearly all students, we are missing data on staff and visitors, which are some of the demographics that also utilize the MU. Thus, if we had more time, we would like to learn more about how they interact with the MU and expand the scope of the app to accommodate them and their needs.</li>
                        <li> <span class="body-black">Create a more dynamic map that tracks your location upon entering the MU</span><br>‍Currently, our map only tells users where services are located. However, if we expanded the scope of our app to include visitors, we would implement a dynamic map that provides directions from your current location. This will be especially helpful for visitors, freshmen, and transfer students who may not be familiar with the layout of the MU.</li>
                        <li> <span class="body-black">Give users the ability to order ahead in the CoHo through the app</span><br>‍During our user research, students shared that they wanted the ability to order ahead at the CoHo to skip the long lines. Due to our time constraint, however, we were unable to implement this feature into our final prototype. We would therefore like to expand our app to include this useful feature if given the opportunity.</li>
